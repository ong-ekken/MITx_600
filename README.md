# MIT OCW 6.00

The course comprises 2 parts:
- 6.00.1x = Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
- 6.00.2x = Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

These notebooks are intended for the purpose of:
- keeping track of my own learning
- helping my own revision
- serving as part of my portfolio 
- learning with others that already COMPLETED MIT6.001

As mentioned in course guidelines, learning programming and computer science is about hands-on practicing. So if you are reading this purely so you can copy answers for assignments, please turn back now. This will not serve you well. 

Further disclaimer: code may be formatted and thus may not work directly on the EdX grader.
